/**
 * GET /api/env-debug
 *
 * Reports the env vars + secrets visible to this app at runtime. Returns
 * ONLY names + heuristic classifications — values are never returned.
 *
 * Use this endpoint to verify, after deploying via Webflow Cloud, that
 * the env vars / secrets you configured in the dashboard are actually
 * landing in the deployed worker.
 *
 * Classifications:
 * - `likelySecret`   — name matches a known sensitive keyword (SECRET,
 *                      KEY, TOKEN, …). At runtime there is no first-class
 *                      way to distinguish a Cloudflare secret from a plain
 *                      `[vars]` entry — both arrive as strings in env —
 *                      so this is a best-effort name heuristic.
 * - `frontendPrefix` — name uses a Vite frontend prefix (`VITE_*` or
 *                      `PUBLIC_*`), meaning it would be inlined into the
 *                      client bundle at build time IF declared in the
 *                      Vite build env. Anything else is backend-only.
 *                      Note: the worker's runtime env is separate from
 *                      the frontend bundle's build-time env; this flag
 *                      reflects naming convention, not actual frontend
 *                      availability.
